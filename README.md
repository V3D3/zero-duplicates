What can be improved:
- cache progress for images and videos somehow (but that itself would only be reliable with hashing - are file timestamps on android reliable?)
- implement backup
- increase support for older android versions (or at least notify user)
- add support for additional methods of comparison of images (this would increase scope by a lot)

Feel free to fork and call it your own. I use the tool for my own media - there is no warranty for this software. Make a back-up manually before you run it.
